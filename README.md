# AWS Identity Architecture Patterns

This repository contains real-world scenario-based AWS architecture examples focused on:

- Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- IAM Identity Center (SSO)
- AWS Organizations & SCP enforcement
- Cross-account access & session control
- GuardDuty & Security Hub delegation
- Migration patterns with MGN, DMS, and Snow Family
- VPC routing, failover, and hybrid networking models

## Why This Repo?

These examples reflect practical experience architecting secure, scalable, and auditable AWS environments. Each scenario is based on either:
- A real-world enterprise need
- A commonly misunderstood AWS exam concept
- A combination of both
